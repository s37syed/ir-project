==============

The main aspect of the assignment was to use the CACM collection, which is a standard test collection for IR research. It is a collection of titles and abstracts from a journal - Communications of the ACM (CACM), and includes articles published between 1958 and 1979. There are altogether 3204 documents and 10446 terms. 

The project was a continuation of lab assignments; the goal to create three programs, invert, search, and eval respectively. Invert generates an inverted index of the collection. Search allows the user to search for a query (originally a single word, now a multi-line string). Eval evaluates the IR system using PageRank scores, and retrieving the MAP and R-Precision of each document from a pre-programmed queries.
